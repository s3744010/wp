          <div>Matthew Bolger</div>

          <div>Who is your labber</div>
          <div>Adrian Luke</div>

          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>Yes I have. I did HTML and CSS where I took Information and Communications in Technology in high school.</div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>I see myself as both due to my interest in both fields. I joined clubs and events as commitee working in the creative department on websites, posters and designs.</div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>I was always facinated with computers where my interest was developed when I went into high school and it has been increasing ever since.</div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>Even though I have worked with JavaScript, I feel that I still have a long way to go.</div>

          <div>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you like your assignment partner to have?</div>
          <div>I have skills on both designs and programming. I hope my partner is much more proficient in JavaScript.</div>

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div>I would say Youtube as it is one of the biggest search engine on the net.</div>

          <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
          <div>I joined clubs and events to further expand my designing skills, but for entertainment and network with some old friends, I would play video games such as League of Legends and Osu.</div>
